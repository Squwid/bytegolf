                    <li>Total score consists of characters or "bytes" in a working code solution (whitespace not included). The scores are totaled at the end, and all holes must be completed to a working solution to be able to win. Hence the name "Byte Golf"</li>
                    <li>Golfing in any order is allowed, as long as all hole solutions are completed by the conclusion of the game</li>
                    <li>All code MUST be written in one of the supported languages and must only use standard libraries</li>
